// This is a brainstorming document on what to do with weather data and user preferences
// Pseudocode for speed!
// The user would first log in, and then select a day on the calendar to have an event.
// The picked day (if within range) is then sent to the weather API.
// From here, the expected weather of that day is shown to the user.
// Activities are also shown to the user, but not too many, or it'll be like spam.
// A list of activities would be spit out by our algorithms, and then filtered based on
// personal preferences. This would then be presented to the user.

// OH. Since the weather API costs money if its not weather for the day of,
// we can charge money if the user wants to plan things, but if they only want it for
// daily suggestions, then its free! But this would mean that its subscription basis since
// the API is a subscription basis.
// Of course, money can be made through ads.
// Maybe we can have modules that the user can add.
// Base module of maybe basic suggestions, then specific events, or restaurants,
// or ping notifications.

// On the basic level, everyday, the user's feed would have a list of things they can do
// based on the location they provide. MY LOCATION. or SELECT LOCATION.
